## 📖 Overview

Many age calculator applications focus only on age computation.

This project was designed to demonstrate how a real-world backend service should be structured and deployed using modern engineering practices.

The application allows users to:

- Create age records
- View stored calculations
- Update user information
- Delete records
- Calculate age accurately in Years, Months, and Days

while maintaining production-quality standards such as:

- Clean Architecture
- Type-safe database access
- Request tracing
- Structured logging
- Validation
- Cloud deployment
